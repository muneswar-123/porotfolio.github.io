        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As a recent computer science graduate from Vaagdevi Institute of Technology and Science and a current student
            at Tap Academy, I have developed a strong foundation in Core JAVA, SQL, HTML, and CSS. My passion for web
            development drives me to continuously learn and stay updated with the latest technologies.</p>

        <p>I am particularly interested in full stack development, where I can leverage my skills to create dynamic and
            responsive web applications. My education and training have equipped me with the technical knowledge and
            problem-solving abilities needed to tackle complex challenges in software development.</p>

        <p>I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and am seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in a
            professional setting. My goal is to grow as a software developer in a dynamic and collaborative environment
            where I can learn from experienced professionals and work on impactful projects.</p>

        <p> I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities in the field of Java full
            stack development.</p>

                <h3> Currency Dectection for Visually Impaired</h3>
                <p> Developed a Flask web app for detecting and classifying currency notes using YOLOv5 and PyTorch,
                    with real-time visual and audio feedback. Integrated OpenCV for image processing and gTTS for
                    text-to-speech functionality.</p>

                <h3> Tic Tac Toe</h3>
                <p> I developed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using core Java. It features both human and AI players.
                    I implemented the game logic to handle player turns, win detection, and board management. I designed
                    a
                    text-based interface to interact with users, including input validation and updates on game status.
                    I
                    used
                    object-oriented programming principles to structure the game components and manage the game.</p>
